    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial we will present an interface under design to facilitate complex searching using [intake-esgf](https://github.com/esgf2-us/intake-esgf). `intake-esgf` is a small `intake` and `intake-esm` *inspired* package under development in ESGF2. Please note that there is a name collison with an existing package in PyPI and conda. You will need to install the package from [source](https://github.com/esgf2-us/intake-esgf).\n",

    "Many times, an analysis will require several variables across multiple experiments. For example, if one were to compute the transient climate response (TCRE), you would need tempererature (`tas`) and carbon emissions from land (`nbp`) and ocean (`fgco2`) for a 1% CO2 increase experiment (`1pctCO2`) as well as the control experiment (`piControl`). If TCRE is not in your particular science, that is ok for this notebook. It is a motivating example and the specifics are less important than the search concepts. First, we perform a search in a familiar syntax."

    "However, `intake-esgf` also provides you with some tools to help locate relevant data for your analysis. When conducting these kinds of analyses, we are seeking for unique combinations of a `source_id`, `member_id`, and `grid_label` that have all the variables that we need. We call these *model groups*. In an ESGF search, it is common to find a model that has, for example, a `tas` for `r1i1p1f1` but not a `fgco2`. Sorting this out is time consuming and labor intensive. So first, we provide you a function to print out all model groups with the following function."

    "The function `model_groups()` returns a pandas Series (converted to a dataframe here for printing) with all unique combinations of (`source_id`,`member_id`,`grid_label`) along with the dataset count for each. This helps illustrate why it can be so difficult to locate all the data relevant to a given analysis. At the time of this writing, there are 148 model groups but relatively few of them with all 6 (2 experiments and 3 variables) datasets that we need. Furthermore, you cannot rely on a model group using `r1i1p1f1` for its primary result. The results above show that UKESM does not even use `f1` at all, further complicating the process of finding results.\n",

Internally, we will group the search results dataframe by model groups and apply a function of your design to the grouped portion of the dataframe. For example, for the current work, I could just check that there are 6 datasets in the sub-dataframe."
